  <p> Far-right and Twitter are very good friends. Even more since Elon Musk acquired the platform on the basis of freedom of speech promises, leading to the reinstatement of formerly banned twitter accounts like the ones of Donald Trump, Jordan Peterson, or Andrew Anglin. Among them was also unearthed the less known Bronze Age Pervert (shortened in ‘BAP’): an internet personality linked to the NRx movement, who grew in popularity among young American right-wing male during Trump’s presidency, thanks to his peculiar tweets and his book published in 2018: <i>Bronze Age Mindset</i>.</p>

  <p> It is common (and sometimes easy) to see the far-right as a mass of uneducated hillbillies flooding social medias with memes, fake news, and all kind of internet pollution. What about <i>this</i>, but fueled by a Ph.D. Graduate in Political Science from Yale who can read the Iliad with the correct accent and prosody?</p>

  <p> Here is displayed a tweet of his craft, posted a few weeks ago, which showcases a muscular naked model on the left, and a guided missile on the right. As a caption, BAP shares an extract of the <i>Nemean Odes</i> from Pindar, including references to three of his favorites themes: war, nature, and less explicitly, women. All of these can be connected and condensed in one frame: <i>Western masculinity</i>.</p>

  <p> Despite lacking the usual crude humor style of his tweets, this one is designed as an elegant one, in line with the <i>aesthetic</i> alt-right posting genre consisting in two images stuck next to each other (like our example), usually without a caption (not like our example), in order to create a visually pleasant whole, and often conveys an underlying message for those who can read between the lines. This fits a mimetic communication model where users can amplify a message, inoffensive at first sight, by sharing it not because it is funny (like in the meme/troll culture), but because it is visually appealing. In this tweet, BAP himself explains the interest of such a practice.</p>

  <p>In our example it is allegedly easier to read between the lines thanks to the text BAP provides: The eagle, king of the birds, highlights masculine traits such as speed and dominance, paralleled with the athletic body and the rocket in the tweet’s images. Still in relation to the pictures, these characteristics are those of a warrior seeking triumph, whether it is to conquer the heart of a woman (as implied by mentioning the muse Clio), or to win a bigger ideological combat that will brighten current dark times. Even more than this, the light (more often the sun), a recurrent theme of far-right online posters, comes from Greek antic cities which represent the birthplace of traditional and aristocratic values that BAP and his peers seem to regret so much.</p>

  <p>In other words, a compendium of masculinity nicely wrapped in an manly package, ready to be propagated en-masse through social by young men nostalgic for an era they never knew, but also by many other unaware.</p>
